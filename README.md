# advent-of-code-2025

My solutions to Advent Of Code 2025 implemented in Rust. The development environment is VS Code and Windows.

![Rust Workflow](https://github.com/jambolo/advent-of-code-2025/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

## Day 1

Simple modulo arithmetic. Other than getting those annoying boundary conditions right, it was not much of a challenge.

## Day 2

Trivial

## Day 3

Trivial. I hope these start getting harder. There are only 12 days this year.

## Day 4

Still trivial.

## Day 5

I didn't know that sort_by_key can be used on a vector of tuples.

## Day 6

Yawn. I considered loading the data into a matrix and transposing, but it was easier to just process it the naive way.

## Day 7

I think this one was easy because AoC has trained me to expect a solution that doesn't require enumeration.
